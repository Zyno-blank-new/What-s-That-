# **WHAT’S THAT?**

<br>

## **OVERVIEW**
**What’sThat?** is a Chrome extension that reduces context switching while watching videos by bringing *AI generated explanations, summaries, and clarifications* directly into your viewing experience. Instead of pausing a video, opening new tabs, and searching for information, users can simply highlight or select content and instantly receive intelligent insights in place.

The goal of **What’sThat?** is simple: keep people in their flow while learning, watching, or working.

<br>

## **PROBLEM**
While watching educational or technical videos, users constantly switch between YouTube, Google, documentation, and multiple tabs to understand unfamiliar terms, concepts, or references. This breaks focus, wastes time, and disrupts learning.

**What’sThat?** solves this by making information available instantly where the user already is.

## **HOW IT WORKS**
The extension listens for user selections or highlighted content inside YouTube. Once triggered, it sends the selected context to an AI model, processes the response, and displays it in a lightweight UI panel beside the video. Users can ask follow up questions without losing their place in the video.
